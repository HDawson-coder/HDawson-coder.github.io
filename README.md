## Introduction
  
I am new in the field of coding and programming. 
I am taking this bootcamp to learn more about it and to start a new career path for myself. 
I have worked customer service in call centers for the last 5 years and do well in people to people interactions.  
I am moving into the field of computer programming because it has always been something that interests me. I was always afraid that I would not be smart enough for coding, however several of my friends have recently moved in to computer programming and encouraged me to move in to the field.  
When I finish this Android+Java Bootcamp I will be looking to be hired for employment or contract work with Android App Development.
